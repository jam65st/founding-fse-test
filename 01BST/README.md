# Instructions for BST
Design a data structure for a binary search tree where each node has a key and a value,
and implement the following operations:
- [X] Search for a node, given as input a key, and output the value found on the
searched node (or Null if such a node is not found)
- [X] Insert a node, given as input a (key, value) pair
- [X] Delete all nodes having a certain key, given as input a key
- [ ] Print all keys in the tree in sorted order
- [ ] Given a reference to a node n in the tree, find the successor node, i.e., the node
whose key is the smallest key greater than the key in node n (assuming all keys
in the tree have distinct values)
